As a data engineer, when you create data pipelines, your goal is to transform data, which can be used by others. Therefor, your transformation code will end up in “production”. 

If you simply write some code that gets the job done, giving you satisfying results, and put that in production, you’re creating technical debt and are more likely to make mistakes
That is because code is a liability. It is likely to change, because requirements are likely to change.

Imagine the scenario where you've been tasked to scrape some vendor website and list their top 10 products. You wrote something that works and gives you back 10 results. You put it in production. At some point you get feedback that you're not scraping the entire product catalogue, just the first page. So you go back into your code and fix it
